## Understanding the problem
Gatitos Petshop wants to become data-driven to increase its revenue. As a result, an ETL pipeline using Power BI was implemented to build a dashboard containing the following information:
1. Total Revenue
2. Mean Number of Pets
3. Selling Amount
4. Sum of Revenue According to Gender
5. Sum of Revenue by Neighborhood
6. Total Revenue by Day, Month, Trimester, and Year

Three filters were also implemented:
1. By Shopping Date
2. By Brand
3. By Product (using images)
